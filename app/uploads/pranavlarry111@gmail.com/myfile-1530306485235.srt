2
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:35,375
Talk.

3
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:36,776
Talk.

4
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:41,174
For the last time,

5
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:45,429
release Abdel Salman Al-Arkan
from his prison in Paris.

6
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:50,549
This is Lucas Graves, IDP News,
signing off.

7
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:54,175
Please. They're gonna kill us all!

8
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:05,333
Release him, or the execution plays live
in 45 minutes.

9
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:12,942
They're gonna kill us.

10
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,475
Stay strong.

11
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:24,488
Destination confirmed.

12
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,785
You should kill them.

13
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,892
A powerful statement, a
Westerner killing his own people.

14
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:41,332
Recalculating route.

15
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,040
They should have called.

16
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:53,387
They should have called already!

17
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,237
No. No. No, please!

18
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:26,853
Please don't kill me!

19
00:04:09,263 --> 00:04:10,663
Go. Go!

20
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:14,123
Come on. Move. Go!

21
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:19,464
They're getting away! Let's go! Let's go!

22
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,273
Go.

23
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,567
I'll take the north side.

24
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,992
OK!

25
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,310
Keep searching the southside.

26
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,144
Lock down the perimeter.

27
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,688
Shit. He's not here.

28
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,371
Get them on the truck now.

29
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,613
Let's go! Let's go!

30
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:17,554
Kimbral's not here. He's got the keys.

31
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,091
Come on!

32
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,130
What the fuck was that?

33
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,041
We got to go, Shu.

34
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,739
Come on, come on, come on.

35
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,776
Where the hell's Kimbral?

36
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,284
You are 40 seconds late, Kimbral.

37
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:52,792
Go, go!

38
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:54,593
Where the hell were you?

39
00:07:10,678 --> 00:07:13,740
- She's been shot.
- Give me room. Give me room!

40
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,006
Alice. Alice!

41
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:19,810
Come on.

42
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,823
Damn it.

43
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,330
Abby!

44
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:34,263
Move, move, move, move, move.
What happened?

45
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,929
She's shot in the chest.

46
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,468
What the hell took you guys so long?

47
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,601
Shit. Fuck.

48
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:42,708
Okay.

49
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,379
God.

50
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,179
She's gone.

51
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,686
Shit.

52
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:55,979
This is on you.

53
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,116
What the hell happened?

54
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:04,997
Goddamn it.

55
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,403
What happened?

56
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,815
I had a chance to blow their weapons load,
and I took it.

57
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,585
- It wasn't part of the fucking plan!
- I factored it in.

58
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,487
- You factored it in?
- The route I took, the speed...

59
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:31,153
- Where were you?
- Did you use your computer program?

60
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,592
Shu, there was less than point zero zero...

61
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:38,326
Shu, the algorithm was solid.

62
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,703
You lost a hostage?

63
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,006
Bossman's gonna be pissed.

64
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,947
Get us the fuck out of here, Hush.

65
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,747
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah. Come on in and sit down.

66
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,488
I'm letting you go.

67
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,320
- What?
- I'm letting you go.

68
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,424
I won't be needing your services anymore.

69
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,905
You know,
the most important thing in this job

70
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,069
is knowing you can trust the guy
next to you.

71
00:09:56,376 --> 00:10:00,346
I told you before.
This program of yours, it wasn't ready,

72
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,248
and you defied the team.

73
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:04,810
My program's not ready,
or you just don't like it?

74
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,352
A woman died.

75
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:09,422
Could've happened without the algorithm.
Don't you put that on me.

76
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:12,058
You want to make all these excuses up
in your head: Algorithm.

77
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,960
Whatever it is, someone died

78
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,929
because you trusted a computer
more than your own team.

79
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,330
You got to go.

80
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,247
Told you we expanded too fast.

81
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:36,929
You gonna sit there and bust my balls
or get back to work?

82
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:41,119
Next time, I'll listen to you... maybe.

83
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,728
How do you say, quote, "I am stupid"?

84
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,790
I'm stupid...

85
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,029
Why do you want to learn Qingdao?

86
00:10:57,604 --> 00:11:00,973
It's almost impossible
for a Western ear to decipher.

87
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,374
I like the impossible.

88
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:07,012
This game, Go, is interesting.

89
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,006
Why do you think you win all the time?

90
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,413
Because I've been playing Go
since I was four,

91
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:15,484
and you started two years ago.

92
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,746
You move everything together.

93
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,359
You take the territory as one.

94
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,856
You take my pieces as one.
Everything flows as one.

95
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,935
When you were at the factory,
none of your guys moved together.

96
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:30,636
You didn't flow as one.

97
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:32,834
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

98
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,002
Maybe I should work alone.

99
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,038
No one does it alone.

100
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:43,949
I guess that's why I hear your voice
in my head when I am on the job.

101
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:47,917
It may sound like me,
but I think that voice is your intuition.

102
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,057
Take all the time you need,

103
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:54,859
but when you come back,
I need you to be a team player.

104
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,357
Don't be like Kimbral.

105
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,464
Don't confuse intuition with ego.

106
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,702
Trust me on this one, Shu.
Always listen to your intuition.

107
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,465
Always.

108
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:26,158
The original communication satellite

109
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,460
set out to solve one problem...

110
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:34,593
how to send a signal successfully
around the bend in the Earth

111
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,402
and reach the receiver.

112
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:40,539
Today, we at Yusheng Technology
are proud to present to you

113
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,842
the future of satellite tech.

114
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:45,244
We do it faster, with smaller units...

115
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,847
Now this is where the graphics
are gonna change?

116
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,516
I don't need graphics!

117
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,551
This isn't Cirque de Soleil.

118
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,554
Maybe a tiger can jump out when
I get to the cubesats.

119
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:56,789
Chin!

120
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,316
A little help here please.

121
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:01,589
What? I like tigers.

122
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:05,655
Okay, everyone,
let's reset and go again in five.

123
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:08,859
Yusheng?

124
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:14,499
Don't worry, little bro. You'll be great.

125
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:17,676
Thank you.

126
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,117
I didn't expect to see you here.

127
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:37,196
Your job keeps you busier than I am.

128
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:41,167
Who knew being a security specialist
was so time-consuming?

129
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,135
I have a job next week in Macao.

130
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,060
So you were in the neighborhood.

131
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:53,946
It's great to see you, Chin.

132
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,838
I wish I could say
the same thing about your brother.

133
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:58,884
What can I help you with?

134
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,852
Yusheng is in trouble.

135
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,522
Genius or not, he's careless.

136
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,825
- Lot of people want to see him die.
- Who?

137
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:09,028
A company called Ruscho
is who I'm most worried about.

138
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:11,297
They're a tech giant
headquartered in Geneva,

139
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:15,327
and they tried to buy Yusheng out
three times already, and he's refused.

140
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,904
These are not the kind of guys
who take no for an answer.

141
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:22,203
He's going to Bangkok this weekend
for a bachelor party,

142
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,500
and he won't take a bodyguard.

143
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,106
I'll pay you.

144
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:38,551
We are family. Not necessary.

145
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,279
Party's over. Let's go. It's not safe here.

146
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:02,541
I'm glad you're here.

147
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,276
OK, cousin.

148
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:05,808
I'm taking you home.

149
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:35,871
I am Galileo. You are inmate 1764.

150
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:39,871
I repeat, you are inmate 1764.

151
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,041
Welcome to Hades.

152
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,716
Attention, inmate 1764.

153
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:20,017
You have been reported to battle
in the zoo.

154
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,952
Begin battle.

155
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:03,725
The battle is over.

156
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:09,797
Inmate 1764, you have earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

157
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:13,505
All remaining inmates
return to your spoke.

158
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,066
You okay?

159
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,836
All prisoners return to your spoke.

160
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,745
There must be someone we could talk to...

161
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,559
to get us out of here.
I didn't do anything wrong.

162
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,325
I didn't do anything wrong.

163
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:50,172
Inmate 1764, report to the sanctuary.

164
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,176
What is this?

165
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,347
Must be where the winners go.

166
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,390
Shu's gone. This is legit.
What do you got?

167
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,462
His cousin says she's been
trying them both for 18 hours. No luck.

168
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:46,198
- Party happened Saturday night.
- What'd you get from the party?

169
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,866
No security tapes, nothing.

170
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,495
All right, I'll look into it.

171
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:54,396
All prisoners return to your spoke.

172
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:57,835
All prisoners return to your spoke.

173
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,425
The first thing they try to do in lockup
is break your spirit.

174
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:28,932
Can't allow that to happen.
You have to stay mentally strong.

175
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:34,880
You have to focus on three key things
to a successful breakout.

176
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,475
What are they?

177
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,451
One, know the layout.

178
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,311
Two, understand the routine.

179
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:47,893
Three, have help from the inside or out.

180
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:51,559
Teamwork. Exactly.
Your favorite one, I can tell.

181
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:56,964
Remember, Shu, you move together.
Everything flows as one.

182
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,435
One, seven, six, four.

183
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:46,438
Are you the warden?

184
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:49,704
Your cousin is a brilliant man.

185
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:55,160
He gave me the details of his patent,
number 34ACJL.

186
00:21:55,161 --> 00:22:00,328
But not number 36BBBCK.

187
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,529
I need you to convince him
to give that to me.

188
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,339
Why would I do that?

189
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,841
You grew up together.

190
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,212
Like brothers.

191
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:15,240
But you weren't brothers.

192
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:18,314
A family tragedy forced you
to live with him.

193
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,185
You hated Yusheng.

194
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:22,754
How he was always smarter
than everyone else.

195
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:26,158
He could've helped a lot of people,
but he went for himself instead,

196
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,583
and he got rich.

197
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,251
And now, his love of money...

198
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,846
his precious patent...

199
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,607
is going to get you killed.

200
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:42,270
I know everything about my animals.

201
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,295
You want to know who I am?

202
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,260
I'm the zookeeper.

203
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:53,278
All prisoners report to the zoo.

204
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:57,021
- All prisoners report to the zoo.
- What did you tell him?

205
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:58,957
What?

206
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,993
You gave up the first patent.

207
00:23:00,994 --> 00:23:04,056
So? They were torturing me.
That one's nothing.

208
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:07,928
- He knew things about our background.
- I didn't tell him.

209
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:14,369
The second patent, what is it?

210
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:20,979
Advanced cube satellite tech.
It's a game changer.

211
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,383
It can override and control
any computer system in the world.

212
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:27,386
Like a cyber skeleton key.
And it's not what you think.

213
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:30,756
This isn't about money.
I patented it so I could bury it.

214
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:32,858
In the wrong hands, game over.

215
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,592
Defense systems, nuclear codes.
No one will be safe.

216
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:49,974
Kimbral.

217
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,419
No, no. Not every day is a fight day.

218
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,983
What are we doing here?

219
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,523
I'm his cousin.

220
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,693
I don't think it's a coincidence
that we both are here.

221
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:18,704
I think they're after Breslin.

222
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:20,305
You know, after spending
a lot of time with this,

223
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,373
I put my ear to the ground,

224
00:24:21,374 --> 00:24:23,709
I just didn't like what I saw,
didn't like what I heard.

225
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,509
How long have you been here?

226
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,170
It's hard to say.

227
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:30,976
My best guess is... couple of months.

228
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,251
What is this place?

229
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,153
There's a lot of rumors, like mythology.

230
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,314
It's called
the High Asset Detention Service.

231
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:38,823
Hades.

232
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:40,550
Greek mythology?

233
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,327
Land of the dead.

234
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,463
Whoever goes in just doesn't come out.
It's that simple.

235
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,498
- Sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

236
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:50,469
The word is the people behind the Tomb
took a beating, did some adjustments,

237
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,990
- and then came back strong.
- Who are these assholes?

238
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:57,242
Spies, criminals,
businessmen, elected officials.

239
00:24:57,243 --> 00:24:58,643
Profit. Big profit.

240
00:24:58,678 --> 00:24:59,811
What makes you think he's there?

241
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:05,309
His cousin Yusheng was put on
some kind of hit list by his competition,

242
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:08,083
a satellite tech company called Ruscho.

243
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,589
There's battle days
and there's truce days.

244
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,890
If you win a battle, you get benefits.

245
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:15,459
If you lose or refuse to fight...

246
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,662
your time in here is very uncomfortable.

247
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,100
That's why they call it "the zoo."
We're all animals here.

248
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:23,468
Survival of the fittest.

249
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:27,105
If you want someone to disappear so bad,
why not just kill them?

250
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:29,872
Because then the world
will know they are dead.

251
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,597
Here, they are just gone.

252
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,314
Then we got to go in, get them out.

253
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,050
Can't go in there blind.
We don't know a layout.

254
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:40,552
- We don't have anything.
- You broke the Tomb totally blind.

255
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:41,653
Yeah, well, I got lucky.

256
00:25:41,654 --> 00:25:43,355
We don't even know for sure
if Shu's there.

257
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:45,490
- And what if he is?
- Look, if he's there, we'll get him.

258
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:48,018
We go in there blind,
we get trapped ourselves.

259
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,059
You don't think I can handle it.

260
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,597
This is bigger than any one of us.

261
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,733
All right.

262
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:11,739
Sir, we've got a data breach.
Someone's in our system.

263
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:14,809
What? Shut it down. Shut it down now.

264
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:29,734
Just cleaning up for the night.

265
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:34,039
Here's the only contact I got at Ruscho.

266
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,880
Not sure if he'll talk to you,
but it's a good place to start.

267
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,634
A sticky note?

268
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,370
- So what do you got?
- All right.

269
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:51,429
Two things. A dark bank account,
code-named Sparrow,

270
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,225
Ruscho's been sending money to.

271
00:26:53,226 --> 00:26:55,560
And they also sent ten million
to Leon Grassi,

272
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,861
a lobbyist
for the private prison industry.

273
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,289
I know this Leon Grassi.

274
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,969
He used to work for the prison board
for about 13 years,

275
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,470
and then he started taking a lot of heat

276
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:07,439
every time I broke out
of one of his places,

277
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,408
so he decided to jump into
the private sector.

278
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:11,643
Haven't heard from him since.

279
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,875
You look very nice today,
but you know that.

280
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,554
Get you a drink?

281
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,503
Not what you got, Tiny.

282
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:41,439
I know you didn't go straight
and get an honest job pouring drinks,

283
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,643
so tell me, DeRosa,
what are you doing here?

284
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:46,311
Could easily ask you the same question.

285
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:48,179
Yeah, well, that's personal.

286
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:53,518
Got a call from Abigail,
this being the first time

287
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,888
you're back in the field
after being a desk jockey for so long.

288
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:00,126
She thought you might be a little rusty.

289
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:02,102
That hurts.

290
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:05,721
He's here.

291
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,868
- Know that guy as well?
- You mean the wannabe gangster? No.

292
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:11,395
You recognize him?

293
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:14,267
Want me to introduce you?

294
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,342
Since when are you so tight with Abigail?

295
00:28:17,343 --> 00:28:20,109
Like you said, it's personal.

296
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,238
How you doing, Leon?

297
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,382
Leon.

298
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,219
You know, one of my men is missing,

299
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,288
and I think he's in
a black-site prison called Hades.

300
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,020
Ring a bell anywhere?

301
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:36,494
And there's this company called Ruscho.
European satellite tech company.

302
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:40,365
They gave you about ten million bucks.
How about that?

303
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,067
Ten million dollars.

304
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,959
Lot of money.
But I think it's all bullshit.

305
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:47,072
Because you don't lobby
for satellite tech.

306
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:48,006
Look, Ray...

307
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,742
You lobby for black-site prison profit,
am I right?

308
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:53,976
- Look, Ray...
- You're gonna tell me what you know.

309
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,967
Move!

310
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:26,907
Hey, Breslin...

311
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:30,008
Good to be back?

312
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,578
No, it's bad to be back.

313
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:38,115
- Leon, who you working for?
- I'm sorry, Ray. I can't...

314
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,957
Come on. Want a job, DeRosa?

315
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:47,599
Fuck, yeah.

316
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,902
There's this private bank account,
and I need it identified.

317
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:53,828
With him dead, it's our only lead.

318
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:57,103
All right.
Give me a day, I'll figure it out.

319
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:33,544
Hey.

320
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:36,314
Where are you coming from?

321
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:39,635
I work for the prison. I'm the cook.

322
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:42,238
Tell me about the kitchen.

323
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:44,689
What do you mean?

324
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,990
How do I get there from your cell?

325
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,227
I got to go.

326
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:58,026
Yes.

327
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:06,678
You are on the wrong side
of the zoo, my friend.

328
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,707
- I need you to kick my ass.
- What? It's a truce day.

329
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,099
Come on.

330
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:38,200
What the hell are you up to?

331
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:43,100
Thought I could work the doctor,
get us some benefits.

332
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:47,340
Turns out the doctor is a lamp stand.

333
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:50,448
My name is Akala.

334
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:51,849
Shu.

335
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,796
- What?
- He connected the dots.

336
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:07,358
Your inside man at Ruscho
sent me down a rabbit hole.

337
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,804
But it looks like I found a guy
who can lead us to Shu.

338
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:14,365
Where is this guy?

339
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:17,300
Right now? Driving the car I'm chasing.

340
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:20,834
Sure hope you know what you're doing.

341
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:22,707
Call you back.

342
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,614
Where you hiding?

343
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,910
Damn it!

344
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,076
Fuck me.

345
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:37,822
Inmates 1764 and 1765, report to the zoo.

346
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:40,453
I repeat, report to the zoo.

347
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:44,494
They tortured me again last night.

348
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:54,372
You were always
mentally tougher than me as a kid.

349
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,001
Remember?

350
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:59,000
You need to be now.

351
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,851
Begin battle.

352
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,667
Battle is over.

353
00:35:55,668 --> 00:36:01,836
Inmates 1764, 1765, you've earned
two hours of sanctuary time.

354
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:06,841
Negative skeleton theory.

355
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:11,004
Use what they let you see
to map out what you can't see.

356
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:16,046
That's how the layout begins
to reveal itself to you.

357
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:27,858
Train your mind to look beyond
the physical wall that confines you.

358
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,346
There's a whole separate world
on the other side of the cells.

359
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:48,084
Hallways, interrogation,
infirmary, kitchen, HQ.

360
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,716
Right now, it's all negative space.

361
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,683
But not for long.

362
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:59,223
I'm gonna get us out of here.

363
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:08,906
Fuck.

364
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:11,070
Come on, Luke. Where are you?

365
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,411
This is the last number
Luke called on his cell.

366
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:19,376
Ruscho Geneva?

367
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:21,808
Should I get Hush in here?

368
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,382
No.

369
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:30,060
You know, someone once told me...

370
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,865
the single most important thing
to remember

371
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:36,666
in solving the hardest riddles

372
00:37:36,835 --> 00:37:38,755
is that they're designed to trick you.

373
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,095
Subvert against your own assumptions.

374
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:45,443
And my assumptions are telling me
that there's no way

375
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:48,574
that you would let Luke
go directly against company order.

376
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:51,549
Look, he just wanted to do the legwork.

377
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,452
Thought it was a good chance for him
to take the lead on something.

378
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:56,616
And now Luke and Shu are missing.

379
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:07,532
You are prisoner 1924.
I repeat, you are prisoner 1924.

380
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,298
Welcome to Hades.

381
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:25,750
Sir, I felt something was going on.
I hacked into the system,

382
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:28,551
and basically, Luke tried to meet up
with Ruscho Geneva.

383
00:38:29,254 --> 00:38:30,321
Are you serious?

384
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:33,602
I told him to stay away from these guys.
How'd he get involved with that?

385
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,288
It was me. I gave him one of my contacts.

386
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,133
Come on.

387
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,512
After you went missing,
Breslin started digging.

388
00:38:54,513 --> 00:38:57,882
He thinks this place was started
by the same people behind the Tomb,

389
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,350
so I...

390
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:04,689
I screwed up. Ended up in here.

391
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,651
Doesn't matter.
I'm close to getting the layout.

392
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:12,296
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing yet.

393
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:15,689
The less contact we have, the better.

394
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,937
Shu, it can't be a coincidence

395
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:22,974
that all three of Breslin's specialists
are locked up here now.

396
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:24,774
No, it can't.

397
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:27,267
Assume they are watching us.

398
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:45,722
Please.

399
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:48,622
He's close to giving it to you.

400
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,394
Close?

401
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,003
He won't last.

402
00:39:52,004 --> 00:39:54,304
Then he needs to give me what I want.

403
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,638
Or I'll feed him
to the rest of the animals.

404
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,758
I've tried to make soup dumplings
since I was a kid,

405
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:17,390
but every time, the dough is too stiff.

406
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:23,234
Look, I don't know what your deal is,

407
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,570
but... I don't want to die.

408
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,962
What they are doing to you is wrong.

409
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:34,168
Then let me help you get home.

410
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,350
They blindfold me
when I go from my cell to the kitchen.

411
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:45,780
That's not the only way to see.

412
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:51,854
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20...

413
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,594
How many steps?

414
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,458
Twenty-four.

415
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,369
The one gift
every prison gives you is time.

416
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,804
Don't waste it.

417
00:40:59,805 --> 00:41:02,537
Visualize the layout
every chance you have.

418
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:08,143
It was 45 this morning.

419
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:09,814
What?

420
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:11,449
Steps to the kitchen.

421
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,181
The distance doubled?

422
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,789
Come on!

423
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,936
I need to get in the sanctuary.

424
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:33,671
Yeah, and I need a Coke.

425
00:41:33,672 --> 00:41:35,232
Sweet dreams.

426
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,079
All prisoners return to your spoke.

427
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:54,722
I repeat,
all prisoners return to your spoke.

428
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:47,434
Even the most complex of narratives
are often based on one simple idea.

429
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,073
The answer is most likely
right in front of you.

430
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,284
The prison is moving.

431
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:03,027
The cell spokes
change entry points to the zoo.

432
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:04,554
Like a Rubik's Cube?

433
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,722
We got no routine. We got no layout.

434
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,757
And we have no help.

435
00:43:11,036 --> 00:43:12,562
Maybe we do.

436
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:18,542
Neo-Nazis?

437
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:21,912
Computer nerds.
They brought them in some time back.

438
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:25,610
They rounded them up
in some random basement in Iceland.

439
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:28,175
The call themselves The Legion.

440
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:31,755
The leader's handle is Count Zero.

441
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:34,925
He's screwed with
more Fortune 500 companies

442
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:36,527
than you and I can name.

443
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:38,295
But our zookeeper's got a problem

444
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:40,994
'cause he doesn't know
which one is actually Count Zero.

445
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,794
He's interrogated them day and night.

446
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:47,270
No sanctuary time ever.

447
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,701
Why does the prison care?

448
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:54,300
Because Count Zero
has acquired the specs to the prison.

449
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:58,082
They need to know who he is
and where his servers are.

450
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,144
- Specs of the prison?
- Yes.

451
00:44:00,218 --> 00:44:03,553
If you can find out which one
is Count Zero before the prison...

452
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:06,121
maybe he can help us.

453
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,179
I need to see Bug.

454
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:48,227
I need to see... Bug.

455
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:50,927
If you want a book on insects,
they're upstairs.

456
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,773
Okay. Right this way.

457
00:45:37,983 --> 00:45:39,383
Bug.

458
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:46,256
DeRosa?

459
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:49,126
Sparrow.

460
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:53,330
- Who is he?
- Come on. I can't give that to you.

461
00:45:53,331 --> 00:45:55,366
The Insect Society

462
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,735
- clients remain anonymous.
- Clients remain anonymous.

463
00:45:57,736 --> 00:45:59,626
- Above all else...
- Shut up, Bug.

464
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:06,110
We've been boys for a long time.

465
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,747
I love what you guys do here.

466
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:14,618
Now, Bug...

467
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:21,258
But I'm gonna have to
kick the shit out of you

468
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:23,126
if you don't start talking to me.

469
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:24,928
I'll get you a name.

470
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:26,421
Thank you.

471
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:30,026
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

472
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:00,795
Yusheng's close.

473
00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:02,433
Time is up.

474
00:47:02,434 --> 00:47:05,269
You're asking him to give up
his life's work.

475
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,471
We both know that
that's not what this is about.

476
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:10,033
You know exactly what that tech can do.

477
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,074
Time is up!

478
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,869
No!

479
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:29,293
Battle is over.

480
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:34,498
Inmates 1789, 3486, 6412,

481
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:36,833
you've earned two hours of sanctuary time.

482
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:52,215
I need your help.

483
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:59,787
One of you knows the layout of this place.

484
00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:07,191
Wait. The sanctuary.

485
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:09,723
Have you ever been in?

486
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:17,734
Give me that layout, I can get you in.

487
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:23,605
We are Legion.

488
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:08,189
We are Legion.

489
00:50:11,122 --> 00:50:12,716
Count Zero.

490
00:50:16,194 --> 00:50:20,587
If you give me the logic of the layout,
I can get us out of here.

491
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:18,987
How did they know?

492
00:51:24,362 --> 00:51:26,559
Kimbral was trying to upstage you.

493
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,503
You told me everything.

494
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:43,808
You work for the prison.

495
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:47,610
I run the prison.

496
00:52:00,632 --> 00:52:03,523
Our Jasper Kimbral? I don't get it.

497
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:06,470
You got to follow the footprints
from the time he left this place

498
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:07,963
to wherever he is now.

499
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:10,201
Hades has got to be somewhere.

500
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:12,308
Yeah, the underworld.

501
00:52:13,645 --> 00:52:15,405
Abigail, can you give us a minute?

502
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:21,675
Okay.

503
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,988
I know we've had our differences,
but I got to hear it from you.

504
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:26,720
Swear to me we're okay.

505
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:30,946
What are you talking about, man?
Of course we're good.

506
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:32,095
All right.

507
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:34,896
And you're still paying me
good money to hack shit, right?

508
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:37,866
Why would I mess that up?

509
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:40,730
So what've you been working on
behind closed doors?

510
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:46,143
Let's just say I'm working on something

511
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:48,637
that will improve the communications
between us.

512
00:52:57,955 --> 00:53:01,222
Hello, Shu. You've met my zookeeper.

513
00:53:08,933 --> 00:53:10,493
We couldn't break 'em.

514
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:13,260
Extraordinary.

515
00:53:14,138 --> 00:53:17,200
Three men,
and they wouldn't turn on one another.

516
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:21,840
But you...

517
00:53:23,715 --> 00:53:25,673
you've got them on your side.

518
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,045
You got them to trust you.

519
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:38,394
I've waited a long time
to see that look on your face.

520
00:53:43,868 --> 00:53:47,066
Look who's here. It's Lukey.

521
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:51,603
Aw, come on. Aren't you guys happy
to see each other?

522
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,050
When the investors of this place
found out that Ray Breslin's protégé

523
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:03,887
had been cut loose, you can imagine.

524
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:07,424
Breslin cost them a lot of money
on their last investment.

525
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:10,225
These people do not like losing money.

526
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:13,429
They needed someone better...

527
00:54:14,232 --> 00:54:15,826
more current,

528
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,932
so... voilà.

529
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,264
Welcome to Hades.

530
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,603
So, we're here
because you want your revenge.

531
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,237
Yes.

532
00:54:28,446 --> 00:54:33,112
Unwavering, complete and definitive.

533
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:42,490
See, everyone in this zoo
is worth money to me.

534
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:45,529
They all have information
that someone out there

535
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,795
thinks is worth millions of dollars...

536
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:51,634
especially your cousin Yusheng.

537
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:57,801
You two... you're worth nothing to me.

538
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,889
Then why don't you kill us
and get it over with?

539
00:55:01,312 --> 00:55:03,392
Where's your fighting spirit at, Luke?

540
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:07,014
This place is designed to give you hope.

541
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:09,286
You win a battle, you get benefits.

542
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:12,055
Read a book. Make art.

543
00:55:12,056 --> 00:55:15,983
You lose a battle, then you lose food.

544
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,859
Start to doubt yourself.

545
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:21,792
Then you set goals, and you rise again.

546
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:26,364
All the drama of the human condition
is represented right here

547
00:55:26,604 --> 00:55:28,004
in my zoo.

548
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:32,506
I'm gonna make sure that you two
have plenty to do.

549
00:55:34,145 --> 00:55:37,981
When you wake up, you'll be the men
who sold out Count Zero.

550
00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:42,252
That should give you a unique perspective
on the human condition.

551
00:55:42,253 --> 00:55:45,816
Inmate 1764, report for battle in the zoo.

552
00:55:52,763 --> 00:55:55,996
Inmate 1924, report for battle in the zoo.

553
00:56:36,307 --> 00:56:37,707
Begin battle.

554
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:24,148
When he's in the zoo,
make sure he fights every day.

555
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,422
There are no more truce days for Shu...

556
00:57:30,428 --> 00:57:34,525
until his will is broken
and we have Yusheng's technology.

557
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:51,310
So you have no layout.
There is no routine.

558
00:57:52,283 --> 00:57:54,048
And you have no help.

559
00:57:55,152 --> 00:57:59,682
But there's always a plan B,
even for these assholes.

560
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:04,828
They try to make this place
look totally automated,

561
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:07,197
but you saw those human guards.

562
00:58:10,067 --> 00:58:11,900
That's their plan B.

563
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,470
What is yours, Shu?

564
00:58:20,778 --> 00:58:22,236
They're alive.

565
00:58:27,418 --> 00:58:29,752
Kimbral, report.

566
00:58:30,087 --> 00:58:32,387
We're closer than ever
to breaking Yusheng.

567
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,553
Closer? Well, report back when you do.

568
00:58:38,129 --> 00:58:41,498
Focus more on getting that patent
than your revenge.

569
00:58:43,134 --> 00:58:45,229
It's a risk bringing him here.

570
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:51,868
He beat their last facility.

571
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,035
I'm gonna show them he can't beat mine.

572
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,491
Let's see some hands!

573
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:09,892
Now! Let's see 'em!

574
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:14,253
Target's compliant.

575
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,339
- Yeah, we got him.
- Bringing him in now.

576
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:20,563
Lock him up, lock him...

577
00:59:50,501 --> 00:59:52,562
Before it was all theoretical.

578
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:54,370
What design is best,

579
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:57,137
what strategy works against what defense.

580
00:59:57,408 --> 00:59:59,002
But now it's real.

581
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,910
You against me.

582
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:06,848
All right, you won.

583
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:10,586
Not yet.

584
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:16,825
I wanted to go more algorithms,
let the machines run the show.

585
01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:18,859
You said no.

586
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,999
You talked about human intuition.
The value of teamwork.

587
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:26,601
Well, there's three of you now.

588
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:29,967
Show me.

589
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:35,812
All prisoners report to the zoo.

590
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:39,182
I repeat, all prisoners report to the zoo.

591
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:51,761
Inmate 9051, report for battle in the zoo.

592
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:54,722
I repeat, report for battle in the zoo.

593
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:27,026
Begin battle.

594
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:55,722
Battle is over. I repeat, battle is over.

595
01:02:22,987 --> 01:02:25,480
You have one new message.

596
01:02:25,756 --> 01:02:29,091
DeRosa, it's Hush. They took Breslin.

597
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,091
All our guys are in Hades.

598
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:33,682
You're the only one
that can help us get 'em out.

599
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,331
Call me.

600
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:48,668
Shu... you can't give up.

601
01:02:50,381 --> 01:02:53,113
What would you know about giving up?

602
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:57,683
You never stood for anything.

603
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:00,290
Shu, I'm sorry.

604
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,792
You just wanted to be rich.

605
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:04,421
What's wrong with that?

606
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:07,823
My family never had any money.

607
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:10,867
And when your parents died,
we had to pay for you, too.

608
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:12,860
Okay? Don't you ever forget that.

609
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:17,470
Go ahead. Go ahead!

610
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:20,169
Lash out! Do it!

611
01:03:21,111 --> 01:03:24,036
It's what you've always done
when you can't control things.

612
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,680
You're always the same.

613
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,626
What?

614
01:03:36,627 --> 01:03:38,119
You are right.

615
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:41,330
I'm predictable.

616
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,202
Kimbral knew what we were gonna do.

617
01:03:47,304 --> 01:03:49,331
He played to my arrogance.

618
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:53,874
He knew I'd take it upon myself
to get us out.

619
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:57,209
He played us perfectly.

620
01:03:58,782 --> 01:04:00,342
How do we play him?

621
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:02,248
Plan B.

622
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:07,355
We stop being so predictable.

623
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:14,862
I'm ready to talk.

624
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,691
The tech details are complex.

625
01:04:19,036 --> 01:04:21,371
I will give them to you in stages.

626
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:24,866
Give me everything, or no deal.

627
01:04:38,722 --> 01:04:40,723
- We're in.
- Ray, you hear me?

628
01:04:40,724 --> 01:04:43,192
- I can hear you clearly.
- Yes!

629
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:46,162
Who knew your amateur
dentist skills would pay off?

630
01:04:46,163 --> 01:04:49,499
Now aren't you glad I spent all of those
company hours in my playroom?

631
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,235
- What do you got?
- I been up for three nights straight.

632
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:54,203
Password breaker hit the mother lode.

633
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:56,572
I'm through the firewall
and into the Galileo mainframe.

634
01:04:56,573 --> 01:04:58,741
Receiving good reads
from all systems at Hades.

635
01:04:58,742 --> 01:05:03,272
My best GPS spiders are working overtime,
and we only have 33o% of the layout.

636
01:05:03,647 --> 01:05:05,348
No exact exit strategy for you.

637
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:07,717
We need an access point from the inside.

638
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:10,079
You need to get Yusheng to work on it.

639
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,747
We got eyes on us 24/7.

640
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:15,892
- Can you get the cameras?
- Yeah.

641
01:05:15,893 --> 01:05:18,261
- I can guarantee a minute.
- Seventy seconds.

642
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:20,396
Maybe 70 seconds,
but after that, it's gonna know.

643
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:21,923
I'll take it.

644
01:05:23,434 --> 01:05:25,434
There's one more thing I want you to do.

645
01:05:25,502 --> 01:05:29,497
Can you get access to Galileo's voice box?

646
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:37,079
What's wrong with the boom box?

647
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,607
Let's move together. Flo was one.

648
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,311
That's Qingdao.

649
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:55,264
Cameras 48 through 58 cover spoke B.

650
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:57,155
We can clear it in 30 seconds.

651
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,044
Now.

652
01:06:11,548 --> 01:06:12,972
Sixty-eight.

653
01:06:14,451 --> 01:06:15,751
Sixty-six.

654
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:17,753
You managed to learn my language
after all.

655
01:06:17,754 --> 01:06:19,889
We only got about 70 seconds.

656
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:22,058
Hush is trying to get the critical data,

657
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:24,927
but he's only got
33o% of the layout so far.

658
01:06:24,928 --> 01:06:27,129
No direct paths to the exits.

659
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:28,792
He's hacking Galileo?

660
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:32,468
- Affirmative. He's gonna need our help.
- Less than 40 seconds.

661
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,337
This is an inverted design

662
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:37,273
that protects the center and control rooms
from the outside in,

663
01:06:37,274 --> 01:06:39,505
that's what makes it so difficult.

664
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:42,678
We need to give him
a physical access point from the inside.

665
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:44,947
Talk to Yusheng. Get him to work on it.

666
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:46,815
Ten seconds. Now.

667
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,376
Just be patient.

668
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:58,027
I heard that a car chase went down at
the warehouse complex near the rail yard.

669
01:06:58,028 --> 01:06:59,895
One of the cars was Luke's.

670
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:02,062
Going down there to check it out.

671
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:03,766
I'll figure it out.

672
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:06,202
All right. Breslin and the guys
are working from the inside

673
01:07:06,203 --> 01:07:08,671
on a device
that will help us locate Hades.

674
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:10,096
Great.

675
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,976
You find these guys, I want in.

676
01:07:13,977 --> 01:07:15,503
I'll be in touch.

677
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,471
The guys we can trust
in most of the spokes are in.

678
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:43,896
Be ready.

679
01:07:47,244 --> 01:07:49,412
The zookeeper has the specs.
Only a matter of time

680
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:52,247
before whoever he's giving them to
realizes they won't work.

681
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:56,479
You have never wanted to learn Go.
I'd recommend it.

682
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,323
Patience is the most important part
of this game.

683
01:08:00,324 --> 01:08:02,425
Did you hear what I just said?
We got to go.

684
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:07,263
We have the manpower, but no way out.
We keep working.

685
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:09,926
But first, we need your help.

686
01:08:14,905 --> 01:08:17,603
I know you get stuff for inmates.

687
01:08:17,741 --> 01:08:21,269
I need a favor, or I tell the machine.

688
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:38,084
You move all the pieces together.

689
01:09:38,655 --> 01:09:40,647
Everything flows as one.

690
01:09:57,808 --> 01:10:00,710
Connection with inside
access point established.

691
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:04,342
Hades located. Scanning layout now.

692
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:15,858
We have the layout. We know their routine.

693
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:17,419
What about help?

694
01:10:18,628 --> 01:10:20,427
We got that covered.

695
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:35,711
- I'm ready to shut Galileo down.
- Okay.

696
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:37,880
Our exit strategy is solid,

697
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:40,749
but you still got to get lucky
to get past those human guards.

698
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:48,390
There's two maintenance doors
on either side of the zoo.

699
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:49,925
When the lights go out,
you got three minutes

700
01:10:49,926 --> 01:10:51,966
before the system starts waking up again.

701
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:04,239
Showtime.

702
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,011
System under attack.

703
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:19,678
System under attack.

704
01:11:21,591 --> 01:11:23,185
System failure.

705
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,361
System failure.

706
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,252
System failure.

707
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:31,133
All systems down.

708
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:34,662
Clock's ticking. Time to use those muscles
before the doors relock.

709
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,667
- All right, come on. Push.
- Push.

710
01:12:04,634 --> 01:12:07,901
I am Galileo. All systems online.

711
01:12:09,406 --> 01:12:10,864
Halt!

712
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:15,475
The intruders are heading west
through hall 23.

713
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:21,244
This way to the medical center.

714
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:28,858
DeRosa, your hunch was right.
Location of Hades confirmed.

715
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:30,658
Sending you the coordinates now.

716
01:12:31,161 --> 01:12:33,429
Communication established.

717
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:35,965
Ray Breslin is attempting to break Hades.

718
01:12:35,966 --> 01:12:38,527
I want you to see how the prison responds.

719
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,069
The med bots are still down.

720
01:12:42,172 --> 01:12:44,733
The system isn't fully online.

721
01:12:48,678 --> 01:12:50,875
I need you cue balls to cover our back.

722
01:12:52,382 --> 01:12:53,874
We are Legion.

723
01:12:56,653 --> 01:12:59,351
Whatever. Let's go. Come on!

724
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:01,623
Cover their asses.

725
01:13:07,731 --> 01:13:12,192
All communications blocked.
Closed-circuit system activated.

726
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:14,303
Kimbral cut communications.

727
01:13:14,304 --> 01:13:16,872
He shut us down. Closed off the com link.

728
01:13:16,873 --> 01:13:18,007
What about our bots?

729
01:13:18,008 --> 01:13:19,508
They're still working but minimized.

730
01:13:19,509 --> 01:13:21,343
He's walled off Galileo's prime function.

731
01:13:21,344 --> 01:13:23,245
Without a clear channel,
I can't control it.

732
01:13:23,246 --> 01:13:26,215
The intruders are on corridor 37.

733
01:13:26,216 --> 01:13:29,051
Clearing all access to main floor.

734
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:32,114
Resetting Hades structure
to secure position.

735
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:46,332
Shit. What do we do?

736
01:13:48,071 --> 01:13:50,239
Hades restructure complete.

737
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,902
Galileo...

738
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:54,107
gas them.

739
01:14:04,454 --> 01:14:07,186
Breslin, Declerc.

740
01:14:07,257 --> 01:14:09,625
Two circular floors
on top of each other like a birthday cake.

741
01:14:09,626 --> 01:14:11,126
The ventilation system.

742
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:14,462
Two HVACs, flow vents and ceiling.

743
01:14:14,931 --> 01:14:16,331
Up there!

744
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,258
Yusheng. Come on.

745
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:31,840
There you are.

746
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:34,880
We're getting pushback
from the terminal in medical.

747
01:14:35,885 --> 01:14:37,445
We're about to have company.

748
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:45,785
Anyone got a coin?

749
01:14:46,296 --> 01:14:47,796
How do you beat a maze?

750
01:14:47,797 --> 01:14:49,562
Stick to the right.

751
01:14:55,305 --> 01:14:57,832
Freeze! Freeze, or we'll open fire!

752
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:07,208
Seal us up!

753
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:15,647
Don't know how long we can hold it.

754
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:26,058
Keep going!

755
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:30,739
I'm going back for Luke.

756
01:15:30,807 --> 01:15:32,847
All right. I'm going to the control room.

757
01:15:33,143 --> 01:15:34,771
Yusheng, come with me.

758
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:49,825
- Freeze!
- Show me your hands!

759
01:15:49,826 --> 01:15:53,024
- Show me your hands!
- Hold it! Don't move!

760
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:54,809
- We are Legion.
- We are Legion.

761
01:15:56,666 --> 01:16:00,365
We got to be in sync.
On one. Three, two, one.

762
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:03,804
- All right, you know what to do.
- Yes. Go.

763
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,262
Medical secured.

764
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,171
Kimbral, report.

765
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:43,969
He's good, but my machine always wins.

766
01:16:44,114 --> 01:16:45,640
Not sure about that.

767
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:49,675
Okay.

768
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:53,921
I give up. You got me.

769
01:16:55,525 --> 01:16:57,415
But you're still in Hades.

770
01:16:57,427 --> 01:17:01,096
And with Galileo back to his full power,
I just triggered his autopilot orders.

771
01:17:01,097 --> 01:17:04,625
All the systems that Hush was attacking
are now closed.

772
01:17:04,901 --> 01:17:06,700
You're never getting out of here.

773
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:14,036
You know, kid, I got to give you credit.

774
01:17:14,777 --> 01:17:16,769
You did a great job here.

775
01:17:17,647 --> 01:17:20,140
You built a prison. Looks like it has...

776
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:22,948
no weaknesses.

777
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:25,554
But you know what?

778
01:17:25,555 --> 01:17:28,856
There is always one.

779
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:12,701
Yeah.

780
01:18:41,664 --> 01:18:44,931
Now I am the zookeeper.

781
01:18:50,673 --> 01:18:53,268
I have this acquaintance friend of mine.

782
01:18:53,743 --> 01:18:56,634
Big guy. And he did me a favor.

783
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:00,082
I gave him this account number, special.

784
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:03,247
Couldn't crack the code, but he did.

785
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:06,811
And he traced the money,
and he traced the account.

786
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:09,084
Sparrow.

787
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:13,724
And you're the one who's behind all this.

788
01:19:14,864 --> 01:19:16,663
Then we made a plan.

789
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,337
Solar system failure.
Solar system heating up.

790
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:31,645
I just told you Galileo
was back to his full power.

791
01:19:31,848 --> 01:19:33,476
It doesn't need solar.

792
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,483
Let it blow.

793
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:50,355
There's the opening, DeRosa, as promised.

794
01:19:51,968 --> 01:19:53,528
Yusheng.

795
01:19:56,372 --> 01:19:58,137
- Freeze!
- Get down!

796
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:01,009
Freeze!

797
01:20:02,245 --> 01:20:05,205
I could've been looking for this place
for a long time.

798
01:20:05,915 --> 01:20:07,482
I would've found it,

799
01:20:07,483 --> 01:20:10,613
but it's a lot tougher breaking in
from the outside.

800
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:14,547
But I knew that wasn't gonna happen
because I know you.

801
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:16,985
I know how you think...

802
01:20:17,427 --> 01:20:22,059
and I knew you would be
coming for me, and you did.

803
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:25,300
I'm glad, 'cause I like working,

804
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:28,693
as you can see, from the inside out.

805
01:20:29,806 --> 01:20:34,802
Hades had one very, very, very weak spot.

806
01:20:39,015 --> 01:20:40,643
You.

807
01:20:50,293 --> 01:20:54,094
Security breach at main door.
Forced entry.

808
01:20:55,031 --> 01:20:56,762
Hades compromised.

809
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:59,924
It's time. Let's finish it right.

810
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:16,284
Stop! Stop! Get on the ground!

811
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:19,051
On the ground now! Let's go!

812
01:21:19,122 --> 01:21:20,716
Down! Down on the ground!

813
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:43,011
DeRosa, long time no see.

814
01:21:43,012 --> 01:21:46,472
Nice PJs. Where's your fucking teddy bear?

815
01:21:48,184 --> 01:21:52,111
Prisoner9051,
report for battle in the zoo.

816
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:57,819
Let's see what you can do
without your tech.

817
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:03,063
After I put my fist through your face,
I'm gonna crucify you, kid.

818
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:20,667
What'd I miss?

819
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,985
Guess that makes us even.

820
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:31,319
Thanks, Luke.

821
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,744
Yeah.

822
01:24:26,676 --> 01:24:27,742
Hey!

823
01:24:27,743 --> 01:24:29,744
- Relax.
- There he is.

824
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:31,612
Nice of you to join us.

825
01:24:31,881 --> 01:24:33,407
Had some free time.

826
01:24:41,357 --> 01:24:43,054
Get in, get in, get in!

827
01:24:56,272 --> 01:24:57,739
Hush, you hear me?

828
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,074
Good to hear you. We thought we lost you.

829
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:02,544
Shu and Yusheng are safe and sound.

830
01:25:02,545 --> 01:25:03,945
How about that?

831
01:25:03,946 --> 01:25:06,109
Plan B actually worked.

832
01:25:08,351 --> 01:25:12,482
Remember, Shu, with brains and patience,
nothing's impossible.

833
01:25:20,296 --> 01:25:22,130
Can somebody tell me
where the hell we are?

834
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:23,731
You want to tell him, big guy?

835
01:25:25,468 --> 01:25:26,960
Not really.

836
01:25:27,236 --> 01:25:28,636
Atlanta.

837
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,271
Are you fucking kidding me?

838
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:32,352
Hades is in Atlanta? How is that possible?

839
01:25:33,576 --> 01:25:36,877
Kimbral, come in. Report.

840
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,272
You're not Kimbral.

841
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:43,008
No, I'm not.

842
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:48,047
But I got to tell you something.
I'm really getting sick of this shit.

843
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,822
So whoever you are...

844
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:53,061
wherever you are...

845
01:25:55,064 --> 01:25:56,488
we're gonna find you...

846
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,000
for sure.
